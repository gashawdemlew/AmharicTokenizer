# Amharic Language Tokenizer using SentencePiece

## Introduction

This repository provides a streamlit interface for the Amharic language tokenizer using the SentencePiece method. SentencePiece is an unsupervised text tokenizer and detokenizer mainly for Neural Network-based text generation systems, where the vocabulary size is predetermined prior to the neural model training.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

* `streamlit`
* `sentencepiece`
* `pandas`

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install streamlit sentencepiece pandas
```
## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/amharic-tokenizer.git
```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
```bash
cd amharic-tokenizer
```
3. Run the streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will launch a web interface where you can input Amharic text and see the tokenized output.

## How it works

The `app.py` file uses the `sentencepiece` library to load a pre-trained Amharic language model and tokenize the input text. The tokenized output is then displayed in the streamlit app.

## Training your own model

If you want to train your own Amharic language model using SentencePiece, you can use the following command:
```bash
spm_train --input=your_data.txt --model_prefix=amharic_model --vocab_size=8000 --character_coverage=0.9995
```
Replace `your_data.txt` with your own Amharic text data file.

## Potential Applications

The Amharic language tokenizer using SentencePiece has several potential applications in real-world scenarios, including:

* **Machine Translation**: The tokenizer can be used to improve the accuracy of machine translation systems for Amharic language, enabling more effective communication across languages.
* **Text Summarization**: By tokenizing Amharic text, the tokenizer can help text summarization models to better understand the content and provide more accurate summaries.
* **Sentiment Analysis**: The tokenizer can be used to analyze the sentiment of Amharic text, enabling businesses and organizations to understand public opinion and make informed decisions.
* **Information Retrieval**: The tokenizer can improve the accuracy of search engines and information retrieval systems for Amharic language, making it easier for users to find relevant information.
* **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: The tokenizer can be used to build more effective chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand and respond to Amharic language inputs.
* **Language Learning**: The tokenizer can be used to develop language learning tools and resources for Amharic language, such as language learning apps and online courses.
* **Text Classification**: The tokenizer can be used to classify Amharic text into different categories, such as spam vs. non-spam emails, or positive vs. negative product reviews.
* **Named Entity Recognition**: The tokenizer can be used to identify and extract named entities from Amharic text, such as names, locations, and organizations.
* **Question Answering**: The tokenizer can be used to improve the accuracy of question answering systems for Amharic language, enabling users to ask questions and receive relevant answers.
* **Speech Recognition**: The tokenizer can be used to improve the accuracy of speech recognition systems for Amharic language, enabling users to interact with devices using voice commands.
